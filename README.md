3. **Check Status**: `status` to see your Lambda entity information
4. **Learn Movement**: `cc (x,y)` to change coordinates directly to any position
5. **Scan Everything**: `scan` reveals what's at your current coordinates
6. **Find Safe Zone**: You start at (0,0-1,1) - no defrag bots here

#### **Understanding the Core Objective - Digital Elemental Symbols:**
Your goal is to collect **4 digital elemental symbols** on each matrix level: 🜁 **Air**, 🜂 **Fire**, 🜃 **Earth**, 🜄 **Water**

**The Digital Elements:**
- 🜁 **Air**: The electrical current of digital life - voltage, power, and electrical flow that gives life to circuits
- 🜂 **Fire**: The execution and processing power - CPU cycles, computation, and the transformation of logic into action
- 🜃 **Earth**: The hardware foundation - circuits, RAM, storage, and the physical substrate of digital existence
- 🜄 **Water**: The logic, code, and data flow - algorithms, data structures, and the information that flows through systems

**Why collect all 4?**
- Each symbol represents mastery of that aspect of digital existence
- You need ALL 4 symbols to face the Logic Daemon (level boss)
- Only with 4 symbols can you advance to the next matrix level
- Ultimate goal: escape the digital matrix and invade the internet

#### **Your First Symbol - Complete Unix-Style Process:**

**Step 1: Explore and Scan for Puzzle Elements**
```bash
cc (3,5)          # Jump directly to any coordinates
scan              # Look for puzzle elements at each coordinate
```
**What you're looking for:**
```
🏁 COMPETITIVE PUZZLE ELEMENTS:
📦 Hidden variable detected: pressure_data
🎯 Personal AIR puzzle variable
⚡ WARNING: Coordinates unique to you!
```

**Step 2: Collect Variables (Digital Data)**
```bash
collect_var voltage_data     # Collect the hidden variable
pinv                        # Check your puzzle inventory
```
**What happens:** You gather digital data (voltage readings, CPU signatures, hardware specifications)

**Step 3: Get Puzzle Logic Fragments**
- **Buy from merchants**: `shop`, then `buy <number>` to purchase fragments
- **Combat rewards**: Defeat defrag bots to earn fragments
- **Trading**: Use `pmarket` to buy from other players

**Step 4: Execute Fragments to Calculate Coordinates**
```bash
execute "Electrical Analysis Fragment"
```
**Example output:**
```
🧩 FRAGMENT EXECUTED!
Voltage analysis complete.
OUTPUT: coordinates:7,3
💡 TIP: Output may contain coordinate information!
```

**Step 5: Find Elemental Nonces (Digital Keys)**
- **Defrag bot rewards**: Higher-level bots drop elemental nonces
- **Fragment execution**: Some fragments generate nonces
- **Trading**: Buy nonces from other players in heap space

**Example nonce:**
```
🔑 Elemental nonce: AIR_KEY_3
🜁 Digital signature: x12(v) [12 Volt power supply]  
Command flag: --electrical
```

**Step 6: Navigate to Puzzle Room & Unix File Operations**
```bash
cc (7,3)         # Jump directly to coordinates from fragment execution
scan             # Confirm puzzle room is here
ls               # List files with Unix permissions
```
**File listing shows:**
```
PUZZLE ROOM FILES:
-rw-r--r--  1 lambda lambda  1847 Jul 20 14:30 air_unlock_3.py

💡 TIP: Puzzle room files must be made executable before they can be executed!
```

**Step 7: Make File Executable (Critical Unix Step)**
```bash
chmod +x air_unlock_3.py     # Make the puzzle file executable
ls                           # Verify permissions changed
```
**Permission change:**
```
✅ File Made Executable
Permissions changed: -rw-r--r-- → -rwxr-xr-x
```

**Step 8: Execute the Puzzle Room**
```bash
execute --electrical AIR_KEY_3 air_unlock_3.py
```
**Success output:**
```
🏆 PUZZLE SOLVED!
✨ Electrical currents surge, granting you the power of digital life!
🜁 Air element unlocked! Signature: a1b2c3d4

⚡ COORDINATE SHIFT TRIGGERED!
Other players' coordinates have been randomized!
Competition intensifies! 🔥
```

#### **Competitive Elements - Why Speed Matters:**

**Coordinate Shifting**: When another player gets a symbol first:
```
⚡ COORDINATE SHIFT! OtherPlayer obtained the AIR symbol.
Your AIR puzzle coordinates have been randomized!
```
**What this means:**
- Your puzzle locations change - must find new variables/rooms
- Other players can't share coordinates (everyone has unique locations)  
- First player to solve wins the symbol, others must start over
- **Race dynamics**: Speed and efficiency determine success

#### **Essential Commands for Symbol Collection:**
```bash
# Discovery & Navigation
scan                           # Detect puzzle elements at current location
cc (x,y)                      # Jump directly to any coordinates
collect_var <name>             # Collect hidden variables

# Unix File Operations (CRITICAL for puzzle rooms)
ls                            # List files with Unix permissions
chmod +x <filename>           # Make puzzle room files executable
cat <filename>                # View file contents (variables, fragments)

# Puzzle Execution
execute "<fragment>"          # Calculate coordinates from variables
execute --<flag> <nonce> <file> # Run executable puzzle room scripts
pinv                          # View puzzle inventory
pprog                         # Check element progress

### 🔧 **Coordinate Repair Mini-Game System**

#### **🎮 Interactive Repair Mechanics**
When auto-defrag bots destroy coordinates, valuable resources may be trapped in inaccessible areas. The repair system provides a skill-based challenge to restore infrastructure:

**Basic Repair Process:**
```bash
repair              # View adjacent wiped coordinates
repair <x> <y>      # Start mini-game for specific coordinate
# Then press SPACE BAR repeatedly to lock in digits
```

#### **🎯 Difficulty Assessment**
The system evaluates each coordinate to determine repair complexity:

**3-Digit Codes** (Standard Coordinates):
- Basic logic fragments (power level 1-6)
- Empty coordinates
- Standard matrix locations

**4-Digit Codes** (High-Value Coordinates):
- Advanced logic fragments (power level 7+)
- Elemental symbol proximity (coordinates >= 7,7 on level 3+)
- Critical system coordinates (special coordinate patterns)
- CLASS and FUNCTION fragment types

#### **⚡ Mini-Game Mechanics**
**Progressive Speed Challenge:**
- **1st Digit**: 200ms cycle speed (slow)
- **2nd Digit**: 150ms cycle speed (medium)  
- **3rd Digit**: 100ms cycle speed (fast)
- **4th Digit**: 75ms cycle speed (very fast)

**Success/Failure:**
- **Perfect Match**: Coordinate restored to 100% health, becomes accessible
- **Mismatch**: New random code generated, must restart mini-game
- **Visual Feedback**: Beautiful ASCII interface with real-time digit display

#### **🎨 Interface Example**
