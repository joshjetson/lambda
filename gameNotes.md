- If a user is being attacked he will also have the ability to stop the attack by the same lock mechanism but with 1 less number and after the attack is stopped or over the player should have immunity for some time from attacks because the user might be working on something
- that would make it really hard to progress with otherwise if they were constantly being attacked
- If a player attacks and it is successful he should also have immunity for a little while from the same player that he stole from
- A player race should have the ability to detect adjacent items
- A player race will have the ability to drop traps that will make it so a player cannot move from one coordinate to another for a certain amount of time. 
  - The player will only have this ability once every few minutes and there will be a cool down period
- One race should be able to scan adjacent squares and know what race a player is the lambda hunter!
- Player Abilities (Cluster Mode):
    - All players can be at 0,0 at the same time without issue
    - 4 players max per coordinate 2 per team unless 5th player is a Geo
    - Lambda: The only player that can pickup elemental symbols and fight the logic daemon
      - Players on the same team will have to sell items they picked up to the lambda
        in order to progress
        the lambda will start off with no money and is easy to steal from
        this is why there can be two of them
        another reason is so that potentially one can act as a decoy so the other could get stuff
        done
        classic lambdas can exchange items freely
    - Ghosts: Can send messages to adjacent players, spamming their console making it hard
      for the other player to type commands or do anything useful
      they can also never be detected by other players unless they are in the same coordinate
      which will cause another player to have a strange ominous feeling.
      They are the easiest to steal from once detected as they are transparent 
    - Geo: Can move freely will not be trapped ever but cannot move to defragged spaces
      if they want to pickup an item they still have to defeat the defrag bot
      can be seen by everyone at all times
      unless special cloak like item is being used temporarily
    - Circuit: Can see where all players are at all times accept ghosts    
      unless they are in the same coordinates as the ghost
    - Binary: Can place one defrag bot at any coordinates they choose until it is defeated they
      may not place another. It will not harm them if they land on the coordinates it will
      be as if it is not there for them
    - Current: Can drop electric bombs which locks a player at a coordinate for a minute
      if one player is locked they cannot lock another player until previous lock time is over




- History: One of the puzzles will be a saying (Those who do not know their history will be doomed to repeat it)
    - Then when the player checks their history their will be something in their that they did not put
